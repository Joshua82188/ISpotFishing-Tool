![SmartScreenDialog](https://i.gyazo.com/f159f686a89e7c21d275422e5dc1db9d.png)

This dialog appears as the software has not been signed with an EV code singing certificate. **Because this is a project and not a business/organisation, the certificate we currently have won't prevent this diaglog from popping up. Please be assured that this software does not contain any malware, or dangerous code. This has been coded for only the purposes specified in this post.**

Starting from the 3rd April, we have now digitally signed our software. This means that there is peace of mind when downloading our software. This ensures that the software released here hasn't been modified, and comes from a true and legitimate publisher. The publisher named on the software is: Joshua Hutchinson.

## Section 2: Methods in the ISpotFishing Tool

The tool has three different methods of detecting phishing emails. These methods are the following:
- Email Header Extraction and Analysis
- Website (URL) Detection and Analysis
- Attachments Detection and Analysis
- Keywords Detection and Analysis

### Email Header Extraction and Analysis

The Email Header Extraction and Analysis method automatically fetches and extracts the contents of an email header for analysis. When a student clicks on an email and unclicks it, the tool will retrieve the necessary email header data, and present this data for analysis. 

### Website (URL) Detection and Analysis

The Website (URL) Detection and Analysis method scans an email and identifies any embedded URLs. URLs can be embedded through buttons or hyperlinks that can navigate students to websites once successfully clicked. The tool will detect these URLs, but it will also display a list of these URLs and scan them for analysis.

### Attachments Detection and Analysis

The Attachments Detection and Analysis method detect any attachments attached to an email. Attachments can include files such as documents, spreadsheets, etc, or can consist of any software such as .exe files. The tool will detect these attachments, but it will also display a list of these attachments and scan them for analysis.

### Keywords Detection and Analysis

The Keyword Detection and Analysis method detects specific keywords mentioned in the body of an email. The tool will detect these keywords, but it will also display a list of the keywords detected and present them for analysis e.g., be able to identify how many times a keyword was mentioned in the email. The following keywords can be detect by the tool:
- Account 
- Debit 
- Recently 
- Access 
- Information  
- Risk 
- Bank 
- Log 
- Security 
- Client 
- Notification 
- Service 
- Confirm 
- Password  
- User 
- Credit 
- Pay 
- Urgent


### How to run these methods when viewing an email

Before viewing an email, you must ensure that you are logged in with the correct account on the tool. Otherwise, the tool will not be able to retrieve or fetch any data from the email you’re wishing to analyse. 

1. Click on the email you wish to analyse. Please note that this must be an unread (unseen) email. If you’re wishing to analyse a seen email, you must unsee it first.
2. Once the email has loaded, you can then click off the email that you have selected.
3. Wait for some time for the tool to collect the data.
4. The data should now be presented for analysis.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THE METHODS IN THIS EMAIL ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ANALYSE EMAILS. THEREFORE, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW ALL THE DATA IN FRONT OF YOU AND MAKE YOUR JUDGEMENT. ISPOTFISHING TOOL DOES NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES, OR DAMAGES AS A RESULT OF YOUR ACTIONS.**
